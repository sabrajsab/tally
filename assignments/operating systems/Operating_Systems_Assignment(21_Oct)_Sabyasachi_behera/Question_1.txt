Q. Find out differences between C/C++ stdlib functions, Windows APIs for File i/o functions: Speed, functionality, control etc..â€‹

advantages of using Win32 API functions over the C++ stream functions :
1. Speed
2. Ability to use overlapped I/O to handle multiple operations at once without threads (and the complexity of synchronization)
3. More specific error codes

disadvantages :
1. c++ stream funtions use os specific apis for file operations, so code using windows api cant be executed in different os
2. stream functions are abstracted out to work in every os.
3. portability
