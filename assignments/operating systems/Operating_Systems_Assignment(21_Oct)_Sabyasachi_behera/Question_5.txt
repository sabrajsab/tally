Q.5 How can the operating system regain control of the CPU so that it can switch between processes?

A. The OS sets up a hardware timer (Programmable interval timer or PIT) that generates an interrupt every N milliseconds. 
   That interrupt is delivered to the kernel and user-code is interrupted. It works like any other hardware interrupt. 
   For example your disk will force a switch to the kernel when it has completed an IO. when programming for windows 98 in older systems,
   programmers had to explicitly call yield() command. Otherwise, no other process could regain control over CPU ever again which would
   finally crash the system
