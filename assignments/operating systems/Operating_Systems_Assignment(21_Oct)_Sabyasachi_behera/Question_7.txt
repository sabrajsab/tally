Q.7 What happens when you’re handling one interrupt and another one happens?

A. When a new interrupt occurs while handling an interrupt, the priority of the new interrupt and the current interrupt are compared. 
   If the new interrupt is of higher priority, its ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) is executed, else the processor continues executing the current interrupt’s ISR.
